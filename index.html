   <h1>My Favorite Things</h1>
   <p><i>Simple things that make my heart smile.</i></p>

      <br>
   <body>
      <h2>My Family</h2>
      <p>I love spending time with my family. My kids are fun ages: almost six and almost two. My husband and I are so blessed.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Traveling</h2>
      <p>Who doesn't love taking trips? Vacations are a necessity for me. 
         After so long of my day-to-day routines, my mind and body need to refresh.
         The best thing about traveling is trying new food. 
         I also love to get pictures and videos of beautiful views. </p>

      <h2>Beaches</h2>
      <p>Beaches are my happy place. I'm pretty sure I was not supposed to be born in the Midwest. I love beaches, mountains, and warm weather.
         80% of my travels are to beach destinations.</p>

         <br> 

       <h2>Cookie Dough</h2>  
       <p>Cookie dough is my guilty pleasure. I love cookie dough icecream (the only ice cream I eat), milkshakes, or raw cookie dough! 
         If I'm baking cookies, you can bet that half of the dough will not make it to the oven!</p>

         <h2>Wine</h2>
        <p>I am a self-proclaimed <q>cheap wine connoisseur</q>. Wine is always my drink of choice but I have my limits. 
         I'm not willing to spend more than about $20 on a bottle of wine. One day I will treat myself to an expensive, vintage Chardonnay.
         I love going to wineries or wine bars for tastings when I travel.</p>

         <h2>Purple</h2>
         <p>For as long as I can remember, purple has always been my favorite color. I tend to buy lots of purple for my daughter and me.</p>

         <h2>Seafood</h2>
         <p>I'm a (sometimes) pescatarian. I go long periods of time without eating meat. But I cannot give up seafood. </p>
